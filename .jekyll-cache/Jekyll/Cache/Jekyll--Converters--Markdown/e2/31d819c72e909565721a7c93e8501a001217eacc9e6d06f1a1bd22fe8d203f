Just after sunset, he was spoke by a vessel, who asked him if he did not mean to go into the Bay that night, to which, Vanderdecken, with a tremendous oath, replied, \"he would not; though he should beat about till the day of judgment.\" Vanderdecken never did go into Table Bay; and is believed to undergone the doom he so desperately dared. His vessel is still seen in the Cape Seas, in foul weather, sailing against the fiercest storm with every inch of canvass set, striving in vain to reach her home, or to send despatches to relatives by other vessels.
