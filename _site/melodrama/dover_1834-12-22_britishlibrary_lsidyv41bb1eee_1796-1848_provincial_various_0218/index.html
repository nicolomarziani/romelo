Melo Drama is taken from one of the Stories contained in the well-known Eastern Tales of \"The Arabian Nights' Entertainments.\" Blue Beard is smitten with Fatima, the Daughter of Ibrahim; and who, by her Father's consent, is borne to the Castle of the Tyrant, in opposition to her own and a faithful Lover's (Selim) wishes. There all the splendour of the East is lavished by Blue Beard to make her happy, but in vain. The Tyrant leaves her free to examine the Palace, during his absence, with a strict injunction not to enter the BLUE CHAMBER; but female curiosity, alas, prevails; and at the request of her Sister (Irene), who accompanies her in her search, she opens the Door of the Apartment; when, instantly, the Key (a magic one) falls to the ground, and to their horror they behold A SKELETON, under which is written “ PUNISHMENT OF FEMALE CURIOSITY !\" Blue Beard returns and demands the Keys,- she gives them all but the one of the fatal Chamber,-he insists on having it, when on its being produced, he discovers that she has disobeyed his orders, and condemns her to INSTANT DEATH! At that moment, while dragging her from the Turret, Selim arrives with a party of Soldiers, FORCES THE TYRANT'S CASTLE, saves Fatima, and the Piece concludes with the DEATH OF THE
