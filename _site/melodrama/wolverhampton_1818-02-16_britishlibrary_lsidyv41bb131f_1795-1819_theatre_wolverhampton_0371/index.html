The dialogue throughout is nervous, emphatic, and striking ; each scene displays the Hero in a different situatioun and whether we behold him as a Lover, the Prince, the Son, the Soldier, or the Man, we find equal room for our utmost admiration. To prove the assertion, we need only select, from the many finely-drawn portraits of dramatic excellence with which this piece abounds, the awe-inspiring INTERVIEW with the GHOST of his FATHER, has religious observance of every direction given him through the medium of bis departed SIRE'S WANDERING SPIRIT, his subsequent Interviews with bis Mother, in which he produces the Assemblance of his Father and Uncle; his Eulogium on the spirits of the former, is a most severe though just detestation of the latter; and the sudden appearance of the Father, who comes to chide him for his delay in bringing his murderer to consign punishment, inclines us to pronounce the CLOSET SCENE A most perfect dramatic effort. The mournful Distraction of Ophelia fills the heart with tenderness; nor is there a person introduced but who produces every effect intended. New characters appear from time to time in continued succession, exhibiting various forms of life, and particular modes of conversation ; indeed, the incidents are so numerous, that the argument of the Play would make a large volume. The scenes are interchangeably diversified with merriment and solemnity, with merriment that includes judicious and instructive observations; and solemnity not strained by poetical violence above the natural sentiments of man; and when recorded testimony a vows it as the favourite production of our Immortal Bard, we presume it cannot have a greater claim upon the Public for every support and attention.","isInterpolation":false}],"performers":[{"performerName":"Mr. C.
