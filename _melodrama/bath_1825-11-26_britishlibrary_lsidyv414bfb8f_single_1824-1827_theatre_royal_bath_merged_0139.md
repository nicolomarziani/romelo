- POSITIVELY THE LAST NIGHT BUT TWO OF Mr. DUCROW, Whose Engagement cannot be extended
  beyond TUESDAY next.
- 'The extraordinary and increasing success in London, of the Melodrame of JOCKO,
  has decided the Manager to profit of the offer made by Mr. DUCROW to perform the
  part of the BRAZILIAN APE, as he produced the character at the Royal Amphitheatre
  with unbounded applause. The remark may not be misplaced, that Mr. DUCROW is the
  only rival of M. MAZURIER, the French Artist, engaged at an enormous salary at Covent-Garden
  Theatre, for the representation of characters of this cast requiring extraordinary
  power of flexibility & transformation.

  '
- 'THE PUBLIC ARE RESPECTFULLY INFORMED THAT MR. SAPIO, Is Engaged for SIX NIGHTS,
  and will make his first appearance on WEDNESDAY, 30th instant.

  '
- For the accommodation of those whose avocations will not admit of their attending
  the Theatre at an early hour and who are desirous of witnessing Mr. DUCROW's extraordinary
  Performances, HALF-PRICE will be taken as usual at a QUARTER BEFORE NINE.
- On Tuesday, Mr. DUCROW's Benefit and his Last Performance here.
