  â€œTHE FLYING DUTCHMAN, or PHANTOM SHIP," is said to be an Amsterdam Vessel, which about a century ago sailed from that port; the master's name was Vanderdecken, whose constant boast it was, that "he would have his own way in spite of the Devil."

  Once on doubling the Cape, they were a whole day trying to weather Table Bay, the wind increasing a-head of them, and Vanderdecken, walking the deck, continued to swear fearfully. Just after sunset, he was spoke by a vessel, who asked him if he did not mean to go into the Bay that night, to which, Vanderdecken, with a tremendous oath, replied, "he would not; though he should beat about till the day of judgment." Vanderdecken never did go into Table Bay; and is believed to undergone the doom he so desperately dared. His vessel is still seen in the Cape Seas, in foul weather, sailing against the fiercest storm with every inch of canvass set, striving in vain to reach her home, or to send despatches to relatives by other vessels. The above, on which the Drama is founded, was taken from a short and interesting account in Blackwood's Magazine.
