  FOR THE BENEFIT OF
  MRS. HOWARD.

  THE WONDER OF THE AGE!
  MONS. GOUFFE,
  IS ENGAGED FOR THREE NIGHTS.
  The spirit and confidence with which MONSIEUR GOUFFE performs his Tricks, Leaps, Escapes from his pursuers, &c. keeps the spectator in constant good humour; nor can any emotion of fear, for one moment disturb the pleasure excited by his varied feats, as they are all performed with that apparent ease which characterises the Animal MONSIEUR GOUFFE is so happy in his imitation of.
- LAST NIGHT but 4 of Mr. BUTLER'S Engagement.
