  is the original Performer who excited universal astonishment in London.)

  interfere with those recreations which usually occupy the early part of the Evening,
  the Curtain will rise at Eight o'clock, and the Performance close about Half-past
  Ten; and, in consideration of the limited time, the Prices of Admission will be
  reduced to - Boxes, 2s. 6d.; Upper Boxes, 2s.; Pit, 1s. 6d.; Lower Gallery, 1s.
