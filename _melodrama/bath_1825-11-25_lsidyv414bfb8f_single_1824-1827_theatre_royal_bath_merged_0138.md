announcements:
- The Equestrian Spectacle OF Mr. DUCROW and his individual exertions met with merited
  success and were accompanied throughout with rapturous applause, the Performances
  of the TRAINED HORSES created the strongest sensations of delight and interest in
  a fashionable and numerous audience.
- 'MR. DUCROW HAS BUT THREE MORE NIGHTS TO COMPLETE HIS ENGAGEMENT, WHICH CANNOT BE
  PROLONGED.

  '
- The extraordinary and increasing success in London, of the Melodrame of JOCKO, has
  decided the Manager to profit of the offer made by Mr. DUCROW to perform the part
  of the BRAZILIAN APE, as he produced the character at the Royal Amphitheatre with
  unbounded applause. The remark may not be misplaced, that Mr. DUCROW is the only
  rival of M. MAZURIER, the French Artist, engaged at an enormous salary at Covent-Garden
  Theatre, for the representation of characters of this cast requiring extraordinary
  power of flexibility & transformation.
