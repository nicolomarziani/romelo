        Tricks, Leaps, escapes from his pursuers, &c. keep the spectators in constant
        good humour; nor can any emotion of fear for one moment disturb the pleasure
        excited by his varied Feats, as they are all performed with that apparent
        ease which characterizes the Animal Monsieur Gouffe is so happy in his imitation
        of: his wonderful Tricks and Exploits have been the admiration of every audience
        he has had the honour of appearing before.'
