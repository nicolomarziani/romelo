        double, place his Feet on two Chairs and extend them till he brings his Legs
        in an horizontal Position and his Body erect - Dance a Pas Grotesque on his
        Head, hop with his Leg round his Shoulder - Balance his Body on one Hand -
        Double himself like a Turtle - Tie his Legs in a Knot and walk on his Hands
        - And conclude with his Celestial flight and Rapid Ascent TO THE TOP OF THE
