  Greater Novelty, Conspicuous Talent, AND MORE WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES,
  Than are usually combined for the WHITSUN HOLIDAYS AND THE FAIR.
- 'The unprecedented and rapturous Approbation bestowed on the Mesdemoiselles CELESTE
  AND CONSTANCE Has induced the Manager to re-engage these most elegant and fascinating
  OPERA DANCERS for TUESDAY, and WEDNESDAY, being assuredly the last nights they can
  appear here, their engagement in Scotland commencing on Monday next, and this night
  they will repeat those very ELEGANT DANCES, besides their Performance in the celebrated
  Military and Historical Drama, founded on the late CONQUEST OF ALGIERS, and as represented
  at this Theatre on Thursday last, with the most intense interest and approbation,
  and in which the peculiar talent of MADEMOISELLE CELESTE is displayed in the most
  striking manner.
